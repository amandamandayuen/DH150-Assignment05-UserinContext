## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
-	This project will support the users who want to gain local or worldwide information (such as government announcements, local news, health and help resources) about the development of COVID-19, keep track of the COVID-19 data, and provide other supports that users might need. 
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
-	The needs for safety is the basic need involved, because users want to be informed and feel secure under the pandemic. Users want to search for health resources and pandemic information to understand the situation and gain the feeling of security and being in charge against the disease/risk of disease.
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
-	Traditional solutions include gaining information through traditional mass media channels, such as TV, or gaining information through search engine, news sites, phone news notifications, or through social connections, such as being informed by family members/friends interpersonally or through social media sites. 
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
-	Current limitations include that the public could be overwhelmed (psychologically) by current information/data from different sources; the information could be fragmented, overloaded, unorganized or lacks factual support. People might also spend too much time searching for information or not being updated in-time. 

## Step02: Target users 
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
-	While the project aims to support the public in general, certain people might be more likely to use the app than others. The demographics include people with educational backgrounds, who own a phone, younger to middle age, who live in urban or rural areas. Preference of users include that they desire to be informed and want to understand both worldwide and local situations of the pandemic. Users might also want to seek for help related to the pandemic. Expertise includes that users need to have certain knowledge/experience of how to navigate an app through a phone. 
#### Where would the users do that activity?
-	Under national-wide or state-wide “Safer at Home” orders, users are most likely to do the activity at home. 
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
-	Since the main goals are being informed and look for help, users would search for information on search engine, news sites or social media sites, watch TV, read newspapers, call authority resources for help, and interpersonally ask or call or text family members or friends.

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
-	Contextual interview with participatory observation is the research method used for this assignment. I, as the interviewer, would communicate with the interviewee and ask open-ended questions throughout the process of the research. I would experience the interviewee’s context and join the discussion without leading the activities shown by the interviewee. 
-	The whole interview was conducted virtually through Zoom and was recorded through Zoom. Since I expected the target audience experience the activity at home, the virtual interview did situate me within the context of the interviewee, even though I was not physically present. I sent the list of interview questions to the interviewee, so she was able to look at the questions while I was asking the questions. The interviewee shared her screen while she was showing me the activities she has done, and I occasionally take notes on my laptop.

## Reflection

  Overall, the interview went more smoothly than I thought. At first I thought it might be hard to interview someone virtually. I also spent a lot more time on coming up with the interview guide than I thought, and I actually found it hard to create objective open-ended contextual and activity questions and also to create contextual questions that relevant to my project theme. Throughout the interview process, although I try to actively initiate more questions based on the interviewee’s responses, I found it hard to come up with interview questions at the same time when I was taking in and comprehending the relative novel information provided by the interviewee. So when I was reviewing the interview videos, I felt like at some points, I could ask more insight questions but I did not think about that during the actual interview. 
  
  I really appreciate the whole contextual inquiry part, because it really allowed me to listen to what a potential user thought and wanted and allowed me to understand the context of potential users. I felt like I was led by the interviewee during the interview (as a listener), as she provided so much information that I could not foresee. For instance, she mentioned that COVID-19 testing booths information were hard to find, as many sites did not provide that piece of information while she expected to see, In addition, she also talked about mental health problems and problems that might associated with other groups related to the pandemic, while information related to those problems were scarce on the apps/websites she visited. She also suggested that a Q&A feature could be helpful as people could have all kinds of needs and questions. There are examples of the insight she provided that I did not think about before, and the information really makes me rethink about directions and features of my project.
  
  Another important point about this interview is that the interviewee is a former student of this class, which means she has already possessed knowledge and understanding of this assignment. This might prompt her to answer in a more professional way related to user research, as she explained a lot during the entire interview process, compared to a true novice who might provide more “outsider” insight. Thus, I really want to conduct the contextual inquiry again with someone who does not have user experience background. In addition, the interviewee might also not be representative for the whole target audience population, so it could be better if I could ask more people with diverse backgrounds to better understand the context, as the goal of the project is to service the public.
